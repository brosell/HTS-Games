# HTS-Games
The games, libraries, and test concepts from some games I developed in 2003-4. All in C++.

## Two complete games
1. **Barrel Drop** - a board clearing game in the same genre as Tetris or Candy Crush.
1. **Picture Puzzle** - a jigsaw style puzzle game.

## The game library and engine (GAMELIB_2)
- coroutines
- particle system
- asset manager
- UI tools for in game dialogs and screens
  - user interface controls like buttons and text fields
  - event handling

## Some ideas, concepts, and prototypes that never made it into finished games
- Industrial Golf
- A hex-board space war game with path finding and motion behaviors

## A bunch of tools that I developed or found at the time
- Asset bundler
- A BFont Maker


and a bunch of other odds and ends
