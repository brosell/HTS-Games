# HTS-Games
The games, libraries, and test concepts from some games I developed in 2003-4. 

- C++ for Win32 
- Visual Studio 6 (I think?) (Maybe it was called Developer Studio in those days?).
- SDL for graphics and sound
- rendering with Open GL even though everything is 2D

## Two complete games
1. **Barrel Drop** - a board clearing game in the same genre as Tetris or Candy Crush.
1. **Picture Puzzle** - a jigsaw style puzzle game.

## The game library and engine (GAMELIB_2)
- coroutines
- particle physics system
- asset manager
- UI tools for in game dialogs and screens
  - user interface controls like buttons and text fields
  - event handling
  - WISIWIG GUI builder

## Some ideas, concepts, and prototypes that never made it into finished games
- Industrial Golf
- A hex-board space war game with path finding (AStar) and motion behaviors (flocking, chasing, etc.)
- something called roundtris which I assume was an idea derivitive of Tetris

## A bunch of tools that I developed or found at the time
- Asset bundler
- A BFont Maker
 
and a bunch of other odds and ends

## FAQ

#### Does all this stuff still compile?
IDK

#### What are your plans for this code?
None really
