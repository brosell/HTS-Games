[Scoring]
Skill = Hard

PointsForLandingBlock = 5;

: how many blocks must be matched before a score is made
MinimumMatch = 4

: how many point per block for minimum
BaseScore = 10

: how much to multiply by for each successive block (i.e. 5 block matches, etc)
: if minimum is 4 blocks, then in this case 5 blocks gets you 20 per, 6 blocks 
:   gets you 40 per, etc
Multiply = 2

: how many points to award per removed block when a wild block is used
WildBlockPoints = 10

: points awarded when the board is cleared
ClearBoardBonus = 2000

: multiply factor when more than one match is made per drop (i.e. when falling blocks match also)
MultiMatchBonusMultiplier = 2

: number of points to be awarded per empty cell when a new level is made
LevelBonus = 5
