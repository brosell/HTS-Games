The level loads and the ball is placed on the Tee. (The tee is responsable for initing the ball?)
The Club menuvers to the ball and prepares to "swing"
The Player is given the opertunity to change clubs.
The player swing the club in a way that tell the system how hard it was swung. (like worms or scortched earth, etc)
The Club cycles its animations and at the proper frame, applies its force to the Ball.
When the ball comes to rest, the Club pathfinds towards the ball to prepare the next shot.


MEANWHILE
Ball logic: 
move itself while there is velocity. (?)
If it comes incontact with a Tile's Face, reflect off it allowing the tile to absorb or enhance the velocity
A bunch of mojo with rolling resistance, etc.

Entities logic:
each tick:
	if the ball is within influence range apply force to ball
some entities may have more complex logic. ie a bird may have to swoop down and grab the ball.



Level class
- load the level's things. in order to avoid keeping a list in memory, 
	write out all the ptr's to a tmp ini file. Populate the world.

- Unload. read back the tmp file and delete/release everything. delete the file
